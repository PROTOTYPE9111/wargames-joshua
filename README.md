## About This Project

**Joshua AI Emulator** is my personal pet project recreating the fictional AI computer **Joshua** from the cult classic film *WarGames (1983)*.  
The goal is to replicate both the visual style of the original WOPR (Joshua) interface and its conversational logic, using **C++** and **SFML 3.0** for graphics and user interaction.

---

## Features

- Text-based conversation with the user
- Famous dialogues like *"Would you like to play a game?"*
- Simulation of military scenarios
- Console and graphical modes (via SFML)
- Interface styling inspired by the movie
- Easily extendable dialogue system

> This project is purely for educational and fan purposes and has no commercial intent.
